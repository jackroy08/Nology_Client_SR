## Coding Conventions

- Use Arrow Functions only (with Pascal Case for component names)
- Components folder is for 'shared' components
- Pages folder is for the 'page' components
- Use the assets folder and a 7-1 sass structure (as needed)
- const nameStr = "Andy";
- const namesArr = ["Andy", "Ben"];
- const isVisibility = false;
- Components should use .jsx file extension NOT .js
- CSS classNames should use camelCase only & import Styles from '..module.scss'
- Strings should use " quotes rather than ' (except template literals)
